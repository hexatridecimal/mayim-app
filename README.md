# README

So many apps need some kind of chat functionality these days. But what
do you do if you want the freedom to avoid vendor lock-in? There are
multitudes of Firebase based chat app starters. If you have ever used
Upcloud or Digital Ocean you may noy want to go back to a provider like
Google or AWS who do not offer support unless you pay high support fees
What we want to do is make something high quality that can be deployed
on a variety of cloud providers easily. Mayim means water in Hebrew,
why would we use Mayim? Well, what do you put out a fire with?

May-I-M as in "may instant messaging be free and unencumbered."

We also intend to integrate Agora.io video and audio calling as a
standard (optional) feature. If you like or use the code please join our
little mitzvah and help contribute! Evry pull request will be
considered.
